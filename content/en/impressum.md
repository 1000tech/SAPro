## Disclaimer

### 1. Content of the Online Offer

The author assumes no liability for the timeliness, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the author relating to material or immaterial damage caused by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of incorrect and incomplete information are fundamentally excluded, unless there is demonstrably intentional or grossly negligent fault on the part of the author. All offers are non-binding and without obligation. The author expressly reserves the right to change, supplement, delete parts of the pages or the entire offer without prior notice or to discontinue publication temporarily or permanently.

### 2. References and Links

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

In the case of direct or indirect references to foreign websites ("hyperlinks") that are outside the author's area of responsibility, liability would only come into effect if the author has knowledge of the content and it is technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the case of illegal content. The author hereby expressly declares that at the time of linking, no illegal content was recognizable on the linked pages. The author has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design, content or authorship of the linked/connected pages. Therefore, he hereby expressly distances himself from all content of all linked/connected pages that were changed after the linking. This statement applies to all links and references set within the author's own website as well as to third-party entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists and all other forms of databases set up by the author to which external write access is possible. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of such information, the provider of the page to which reference is made is solely liable, not the one who merely refers to the respective publication via links.

### 3. Copyright and Trademark Law

The author endeavors to respect the copyrights of the graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used in all publications, to use graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts created by himself or to resort to license-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts. All trademarks and trademarks mentioned on the website and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the respective valid trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The mere mention does not imply that trademarks are not protected by third-party rights! The copyright for published objects created by the author himself remains solely with the author of the pages. Reproduction or use of such graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the express consent of the author.

### 4. Legal Validity of this Disclaimer

This disclaimer is to be regarded as part of the internet offer from which reference was made to this page. If parts or individual formulations of this text do not, no longer or not completely correspond to the applicable legal situation, the remaining parts of the document remain unaffected in their content and validity.
